# diabetes_classifier
We imported and used libraries such as Scikit learn, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and others enabling us to effectively process, visualize, and create models to classify the 50-dimension feature vector to three labels indicating days until inpatient readmission. We investigated four classification methods: Feedforward Neural Networks, K Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, and Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees.
